    "# Markov Assupmtion\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Markov Assumption** refers to a simplifying assumption in probability theory and statistics, particularly in the context of stochastic processes such as Markov chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "The Markov Assumption states that the future state of a process depends only on its present state and not on its past states. In other words, the future is conditionally independent of the past, given the present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, if (X_t) represents the state of a process at state (n), the Markov Assumption implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "                        P(X{n+1} | Xn)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the probability of transitioning to the next state \\( X{n+1} \\) depends only on the current state \\( Xn \\), not on the sequence of states that preceded it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "Imagine a random walk where a person moves between different positions on a line. The probability that they will move to a new position depends only on their current position, not on how they got there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at state \\( n \\), they are at position \\( Xn \\), the probability of moving to a new position \\( X{n+1} \\) depends solely on where they are at \\( n \\) (i.e., \\( Xn \\)), and not on the entire sequence of positions they took to get to \\( Xn \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is the Markov Assumption Useful?**\n",
    "- **Simplifies complex systems**: By assuming that the current state captures all relevant information, we can model systems more easily.\n",
    "- **Efficient computation**: In a Markov model, you only need to track the current state, reducing computational complexity.\n",
    "- **Common in machine learning**: The assumption is frequently used in models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Reinforcement Learning, where predicting future outcomes is based on the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations:**\n",
    "The Markov Assumption is a simplification and may not hold in all situations. Real-world processes often have dependencies on past states (memory) that cannot be ignored. However, in cases where the assumption is reasonable, it can greatly simplify analysis and computations."
