    "### Step 2: Link your account to Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To link your GitHub account to the terminal using the new **Personal Access Token (PAT)** feature, follow these step-by-step instructions. GitHub now requires using tokens instead of passwords for command-line operations like pushing, pulling, and cloning repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Go to GitHub:**\n",
    "   - Open your web browser and go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sign in to Your Account:**\n",
    "   - Log in to your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Access Settings:**\n",
    "   - In the upper-right corner, click on your profile icon and select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Go to Developer Settings:**\n",
    "   - On the left sidebar, scroll down and click on **Developer settings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Go to Personal Access Tokens:**\n",
    "   - Under **Developer settings**, click on **Personal access tokens**.\n",
    "   - Select **Tokens (classic)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generate a New Token:**\n",
    "   - Click the **Generate new token (classic)** button.\n",
    "   - Provide a descriptive name for your token in the **Note** field (e.g., \"My Laptop Token\").\n",
    "   - **Expiration Date**: Set an expiration date. Choose as per your preference, or set it to \"No Expiration\" if you don't want it to expire soon.\n",
    "   - **Select Scopes**: Choose the scopes (permissions) for the token. For common Git operations, you’ll need:\n",
    "     - `repo` (for full control of private repositories)\n",
    "     - `workflow` (if you're using GitHub Actions)\n",
    "     - `write:packages` (if you're using GitHub Packages)\n",
    "     - `delete_repo` (if you need to delete repositories)\n",
    "   - Click **Generate token**.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Copy the Token:**\n",
    "   - Once the token is generated, **copy** it. You **won’t be able to see this token again**, so make sure you copy it and store it safely (e.g., in a password manager).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Configure Git to Use the Personal Access Token\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Terminal:**\n",
    "   - On macOS or Linux, open your Terminal.\n",
    "   - On Windows, you can use Git Bash or Command Prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Global Username and Email:**\n",
    "   - Run the following commands to set your GitHub username and email for Git operations. Replace `your_username` and `your_email@example.com` with your actual GitHub username and email:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git config --global user.name \"your_username\"\n",
